# Documentation
Guides and quickstarts for integrating DAITA's products.

## Preview
MkDocs includes a live preview server, so we can preview our changes as we write our documentation. The server will automatically rebuild the site upon saving. Start it with:
```
mkdocs serve
```
Point the browser to [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000/).
## Building the Site
We can build a static site from our Markdown files with:
```
mkdocs build
```
